# Manuscript Template (Structured Abstract)

## Background
- Brief context on teledermatology growth and quality bottlenecks.

## Objective
- Evaluate whether automated image quality gating improves AI triage safety.

## Methods
- Data sources, synthetic augmentation, DIQA model details, triage simulation protocol.

## Results
- Report DIQA AUROC/AP, fairness gaps, triage accuracy/urgent recall, retake rate, latency/token deltas.

## Conclusions
- Interpret clinical relevance, safety considerations, deployment roadmap.

## Keywords
